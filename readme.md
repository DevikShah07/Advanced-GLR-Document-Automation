Advanced GLR Document Automation
Overview
Advanced GLR Document Automation is a Python-based project designed for the automation and processing of documents, likely leveraging advanced parsing techniques or document AI services. The repository centers around processing unstructured or semi-structured documents to extract meaningful information, automate paperwork, or integrate with document processing APIs.

Features
Automates extraction of information from documents.

Likely leverages state-of-the-art document AI, OCR, or parsing technologies.

Designed for extensibility in document workflow automation tasks.

Implemented in Python, making it accessible and modifiable for data scientists, developers, and automation engineers.

Repository Structure
File/Folder	Description
task_3_code.py	Main script for automating document processing tasks (possibly connects with a document AI API or runs local parsers).
requirnment.txt	Contains Python dependencies necessary for running the project.
readme.md	Placeholder or existing documentation (should be replaced with this file).
Installation
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/DevikShah07/Advanced-GLR-Document-Automation.git
cd Advanced-GLR-Document-Automation
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirnment.txt
Make sure you are using Python 3.7 or above.

Usage
Prepare your input documents — Ensure your documents are accessible to the script (local file path or as required by the main script).

Run the main script

bash
python task_3_code.py
Follow any prompts or adjust script parameters as necessary.

Review the output for extracted/formatted data.

Customize as needed — The script can be modified for different document formats or use-cases.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or newer

All Python packages listed in requirnment.txt

(Optional) Access to online document AI or OCR APIs, if the script is designed for cloud-based processing
